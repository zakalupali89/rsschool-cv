## About me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a beginner web developer. Having tried to program, I realized that this is the work that brings me pleasure. I am focusing on studying
the front-end part, and the back-end in the background. I use a variety of courses to learn. At the moment I am involved in the development
of a web application, in which I perform the tasks of frontend (react.js, bootstrap) - 80% and backend (next.js) - 20%. I have been involved
in this project for 8 months.
